**Why does this project exist?**
As part of the *Team Project* module, we were tasked with forming a team of four and developing a software application that solves a real-world problem.

We chose to address the issue of commuting costs for NCI students. The existing Irish Rail fare calculator can be difficult to navigate, particularly for commuters travelling along the south-western lines.

To ensure a manageable scope, we limited our application to the **Dublin Commuter Zone**, as a significant proportion of Dublin's commuters travel within this area.

Our goal was to create a simplified, user-friendly web application that:
- Calculates travel fares quickly and clearly
- Displays upcoming departures from selected stations
- Highlights nearby bus services
- Provides information on rentable bicycles where applicable

At its core, EasyFare functions as a simplified fare calculator and commuter information hub.

Users can:
- Select their Leap Card type
- Choose their travel zone (1 - 4)
- Select a station, bus stop, or Luas stop
- Instantly view fare information retrieved from our database

The system is designed to be quick, clear, and straightforward.
